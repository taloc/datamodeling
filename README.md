# Data modeling with PostgreSQL for a music app

# Description:
Business requirement:
Music store Sparkify requires to analyze user activity on their new music streaming app.
By creating an automated ETL pipeline the company will have access to insights from their data allowing them to make better decisions to increase customer service and revenue of the company.

Objective:
1) Create an ETL pipeline to extract data from 2 json file sources; 2) Create a PostgreSQL database with 5 tables; 3) Run a couple of queries to validate data loaded correctly.

# Table of contents:
a) SQL queries in .py files:
- create_tables.py
- sql_queries.py

b) Python file to run the ETL pipeline:
- etl.py

c) Jupyter notebook files with explanation on how I reached to the etl.py script:
- etl.ipynb
- test.ipynb

d) Entity relationship diagram:
- ERD for Sparkify

# Installation:
